# Newsy

Introducing [**Newsy**](https://newsy.surge.sh), a newsletter platform powered entirely by GitHub.

Newsy is heavily inspired by tools like [Utterances](https://utteranc.es), [Giscus](https://giscus.app), and [Gitalk](https://gitalk.github.io), which reimagined commenting for static sites using GitHub Issues. Newsy takes the same GitHub-driven approach and brings it to newsletters: instead of relying on external services or maintaining a separate mailing list, your newsletter lives right alongside your code in your GitHub repository.

New here? Read the [Getting Started](getstarted.html) guide.

## Why GitHub?

1. **No mailing list management** — Subscribers and updates are tracked via GitHub.
2. **No expensive email APIs** — Eliminate costly third-party newsletter subscriptions.
3. **No deliverability headaches** — Avoid complex SMTP setups and spam filters.
4. **No database security concerns** — Leverage GitHub's authentication and security.
5. **No rigid template builders** — Write purely in Markdown or HTML.

**You just write. GitHub handles the rest.**

Publishing should be accessible to everyone. You shouldn't need to pay for a SaaS platform or spend hours wrestling with email infrastructure just to share updates with your readers.

## Technical Specifications

Written in **Go**, Newsy is lightweight, simple to deploy, and designed to run virtually for free using **serverless functions / Lambda-compatible runtimes**. Deploy it once, configure it, and let it run.

- **Runs locally** for development and testing.
- **Deploys serverless** (e.g., Vercel, AWS Lambda) for production.
- **WebAssembly support**: Host on any serverless runtime even on JavaScript/TypeScript-only platforms by compiling the Go binary to WebAssembly with [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org).

A video walkthrough of the local setup is available in the [video guide](/video.html).

## Self Host Your Bot

Follow these steps to run Newsy and connect it to your GitHub repositories.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pratyay360/newsy.git
cd newsy
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

We use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) to keep the development environment consistent and easy to manage:

```bash
mise deps
```

### 3. Build and Run

Build and run the Go binary:

```bash
go build
./newsy
```

### 4. Configure the GitHub App

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
2. If you need to expose your local server, use a tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/), or SSH tunneling via [localhost.run](http://localhost.run/):

```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 localhost.run
```

3. Open your tunnel URL (e.g., `https://xyz.localhost.run`) in your browser:

![Webhook configuration](https://s6.imgcdn.dev/YgEOzv.png)

*(If you run into issues, refer to the [video guide](/video.html) or try an alternative tunneling provider.)*

4. Choose an **App name** (preferably unique).
5. Paste the tunnel URL into the **Webhook URL** field and submit.
6. A `.env` file containing your app's secrets will be generated in your project root. Keep this file safe.

The generated `.env` should look like this:

```dotenv
APP_ID=""
WEBHOOK_SECRET=""
PRIVATE_KEY=""
DATABASE_URL=""
```

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> Install the GitHub App on **specific repositories only**, rather than on "All repositories".

Each instance of Newsy can be shared across multiple repositories or users.

> \[!NOTE\]
> By default, Newsy only triggers comments and issues upon the creation of new content files (`.html`, `.md`, `.mdx`, etc.), rather than on subsequent edits.

## Try Newsy via the Hosted Instance

You can test Newsy directly using the hosted version:

👉 [**https://newsy.surge.sh/**](https://newsy.surge.sh/)

## Deploy on Vercel

![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)

Once deployed, update your GitHub App's Webhook URL from `*.localhost.run` to your production domain: `https://<your-app>.vercel.app`.

See the [Vercel setup guide](vercel-setup-guide.html) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

> \[!WARNING\]
> Only use the deploy button if you already have a configured GitHub App and have its credentials ready. Otherwise, follow the [Self-Host Your Bot](#self-host-your-bot) steps first to create one.

## Operating Costs &amp; Resource Usage

Vercel and many other cloud providers offer generous free tiers for server less workloads. You can also host Newsy on server less runtimes limited to JavaScript/Type Script by compiling the Go binary to Web Assembly with [Tiny-go](https://tinygo.org).

Because it is a compiled Go binary:

- **Low memory footprint**, comfortably staying well within serverless memory and execution limits.

## Generate Your Subscription Button

Generate an embedded subscription button for your account at [**newsy.surge.sh**](https://newsy.surge.sh/).

You can customize and style the button using [Primer CSS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Primer).

> \[!TIP\]
> **Security tip:** After the bot publishes its first newsletter issue, lock the issue conversation to prevent unauthorized comments from triggering unintended behavior.
